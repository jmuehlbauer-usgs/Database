# Database
Data uploads from the Foodbase database. Deprecated as of 2021-02-16. Please see new repository on Git Lab at https://code.usgs.gov/sbsc/gcmrc/foodbase/database (internal to DOI users). Data download and interaction using the `R` `foodbase` package still works as before, although you will need to install the new version of that package from GitHub to work with the latest data (https://github.com/jmuehlbauer-usgs/R-packages/tree/master/foodbase).
